Zara is considering three different options: opening a tailoring shop, a clothing shop, or a jewelry shop. Anwar has also identified three different ideas: opening a restaurant, a bakery, or a coffee shop. They discuss their ideas together.</string>

    <string name="lesson_1_theory_model">Most successful new businesses address two related issues – one is an unmet customer need; the second is a new idea for meeting this need, either a new business approach or a new technology. For your business idea to work, you should try to consider both items. \n\nTake for example good quality coffee shops. Previously in many countries, coffee was not a luxury item, it was sold in restaurants or on street corners by vendors at low price. But as people have gotten wealthier, demand for quality coffee, a small luxury, has grown; meanwhile, some entrepreneurs spotted this new unmet need and came up with a new business model, providing quality coffee in comfortable environments – and successful cafes have sprouted up all over. \n\nTo come up with a business idea, try to think of: \n- What people need or want but don’t have. \n- Resources that you have access to and could use. \n- Your own strengths, talents and interests. \n- A problem you have experienced or observed, and for which you think you have a solution. \n\nAlways make sure these two things go together – Unmet customer needs and new, innovative solutions.</string>
