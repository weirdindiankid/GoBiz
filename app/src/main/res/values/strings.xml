    <string name="lesson_1_conclusion">Entrepreneurship is not easy, but it can be really rewarding. \n\nThe fact is, most entrepreneurs don’t succeed in their first try at starting a business. We learn from our mistakes. But the best way to avoid mistakes is to be aware of what they potentially can be. Consider the following as you go forward, and perhaps adjust as needed. \n\nThe most common errors made by people starting businesses include:\n
        \n\u2022\t Under-estimating the costs or resources needed.
        \n\u2022\t Not meeting customers’ quality requirements.
        \n\u2022\t Being weak on sales and marketing of your new business
        \n\u2022\t Not managing the finances well – poor accounting.
        \n\u2022\t Not being flexible and adjusting as you start.
        \n\u2022\t Not knowing your competition, and how you can do better than them.
        \n\u2022\t Setting your price too high or too low.
        \n\u2022\t Thinking that success will come easily, quickly or without lots of work.
        \n\nThe following modules will help on much of this – but the best start will be for you to consider these points and keep improving your plan.</string>

    <string name="lesson_1_exercise_instructions">To find a good business idea, do the following:</string>
    <string name="lesson_2_exercise_instructions">Consider the pros and cons of being an entrepreneur - write them down on a separate paper as in the table below. If you have a friend or family member you can discuss this with, please do so.</string>
    <string name="lesson_2_exercise_followup">Now answer for yourself, if you had to put these onto a scale, to see which would weigh more, which would you say weighs more?\n\nEntrepreneurship is hard work, and can be risky. If you don\'t feel the benefits of being an entrepreneur outweigh those costs, you may want to consider carefully your options. Throughout this programme, consider these pros and cons, and others you see – this programme should help you decide on whether to try to start your own business.</string>
    <string name="lesson_1_exercise_part_1">On one side of a piece of paper write 5 or 10 unmet needs you know about – things you wish you had in your everyday life, or that people you know have mentioned – like good quality coffee (or low priced t-shirts, or designer candles…).</string>
    <string name="lesson_1_exercise_part_2">Then, on the other side of the paper, try coming up with solutions to these unmet needs, innovative things that could be done to address them.</string>
    <string name="lesson_1_factoid_1">An estimated 50% of business failure is the result of incompetence.</string>
    <string name="lesson_1_factoid_2">Of the other half, 30% is due to lack of managerial experience, 10% due to lack of general business experience, and the rest the result of fraud, natural disasters and neglect.</string>

    <string name="lesson_1_story_intro">Zara and Anwar have both been thinking about starting a new business. Zara is considering three different options: opening a tailoring shop, a clothing shop, or a jewelry shop. Anwar has also identified three different ideas: opening a restaurant, a bakery, or a coffee shop. They discuss their ideas together.</string>

    <string name="lesson_1_success_story">In 2007 Ritthy Paiborn was working in his father’s restaurant, doing everything from waiting on tables to washing dishes to cooking food. Like his father did as well. But whenever foreigners came in, they asked if they had coffee – and when he served the usual powdered type Nescafe, they complained. \n\nRitthy realized there was an unmet customer demand – people wanted good, Italian style espresso coffee. And they were willing to pay for it. With a bit of savings and a loan from his father, he bought an Italian coffee machine, put it outside their restaurant, and created Ritthy’s Café with sidewalk seating for five. The business flourished, selling coffee to both the restaurant customers – which helped grow his father’s business – and to people outside. \n\nToday, seven years later, Ritthy runs 10 Ritthy’s Cafes around Phnom Penh and Siem Reap, and is one of Cambodia’s best known entrepreneurs – all because he saw a customer need and found a way to meet it.</string>
    <string name="lesson_2_success_story">John Paul DeJoria co-founded both Paul Mitchell hair products and Patrón tequila, becoming a billionaire along the way. The path to success wasn\'t always easy for him, though. DeJoria spent time on the streets twice. The first time he was homeless, he was only 22 and had a two-year-old son to care for. He persisted in his entrepreneurial vision, though, eventually co-founding John Paul Mitchell Systems with $700 in startup cash. Today, DeJoria is a philanthropist who supports a number of social causes. Among other things, he helps to provide resources to people dealing with homelessness.</string>

    <string name="lesson_1_theory_model">Most successful new businesses address two related issues – one is an unmet customer need; the second is a new idea for meeting this need, either a new business approach or a new technology. For your business idea to work, you should try to consider both items. \n\nTake for example good quality coffee shops. Previously in many countries, coffee was not a luxury item, it was sold in restaurants or on street corners by vendors at low price. But as people have gotten wealthier, demand for quality coffee, a small luxury, has grown; meanwhile, some entrepreneurs spotted this new unmet need and came up with a new business model, providing quality coffee in comfortable environments – and successful cafes have sprouted up all over. \n\nTo come up with a business idea, try to think of: \n- What people need or want but don’t have. \n- Resources that you have access to and could use. \n- Your own strengths, talents and interests. \n- A problem you have experienced or observed, and for which you think you have a solution. \n\nAlways make sure these two things go together – Unmet customer needs and new, innovative solutions.</string>
    <string name="lesson_2_theory_model">The Oxford Dictionary defines entrepreneur as \"A person who sets up a business or businesses, taking on financial risks in the hope of profit.\"  This, though, only captures part of what entrepreneurship is about.\n\nEntrepreneurs are risk-takers, people who chose the challenging over the easily chosen.  Typically they are are creators and innovators, people who invent something new.  They typically have to work hard, to be able to achieve the results desired in spite of doing something new.\n\nEntrepreneurs pursue entrepreneurship because they hope for a greater reward – but this is not always financial – the reward could be a hope for independence, or for having the opportunity to do something they love.  In some cases, it is due to necessity – being an entrepreneur is the best option, as other forms of income generation are much less attractive or don’t exist.\n\nIn this module, we will explore the nature of entrepreneurship, the basis of business innovation and startup, and ask you to consider – are you an entrepreneur?  Is this the path for you?\n\nTaking this into account, consider the following traits of an entrepreneur.  Consider which of these you think you have, and which you think you could develop further.  With these in mind, you will consider whether you are ready for entrepreneurship.</string>

    <string name="lesson_2_review_prompt_2">Do you have the traits of an entrepreneur? If not, do you think you can develop them – and how?</string>
    <string name="lesson_2_review_followup">Think about the answers you provided to each of these.  Does the answer you provided give any clarity to what your vision is for your future?  Sometimes people do things for the wrong reasons – to meet the expectations of friends or family, for example, rather than what is in their heart.  With this programme, you should consider what is right for you – and how to get what is right to work.\n\nIf that is entrepreneurship, then this should help you figure out how best to do something new and innovative for your livelihood.  If it is not, then the programme should help you know your best way forward, working for someone or some organization, adding value and being more entrepreneurial.</string>
    <string name="lesson_2_factoid_1">It\'s often stated that around 90% of startups fail or eventually close down. While this number may misrepresent the real ratio between business success and failure, the key is figuring out how to increase your business\' chances for success – something we cover in this app.</string>
    <string name="lesson_2_factoid_2">After 4 years of operation, approximately 50% of new businesses are still open. While most businesses eventually fail, many entrepreneurs try again, with a better understanding of how to succeed.</string>
    <string name="lesson_2_factoid_3">The key to success is to consider your market, come up with a good product or service, plan carefully to eliminate risks, and make sure you do the best job possible to meet customer demand while managing resources.</string>
    <string name="lesson_2_conclusion">Entrepreneurship is not for everyone, but it may be for you.
There are a number of traits that commonly are applied to entrepreneurs, particularly successful entrepreneurs – hard working visionaries, risk takers that are innovative and financially adept, able to pursue a plan with passion and commitment.

\n\nIf that doesn’t sound like you – if one or more of the traits listed don’t apply, that doesn’t mean you wouldn’t make a successful entrepreneur.  In some cases you can develop new skills and abilities. In other cases, you can have others support you, if for example you are not detail oriented, or need to develop increased financial understanding.

\n\nThe key point is having the drive and vision – do you really want to start a business, a business you are passionate about and can commit to pursuing – then the main obstacles to successful entrepreneurship is already overcome.  Drive and desire will take a long ways toward success.

\n\nThe following modules will help you pursue your dreams in a more structured, systematic manner.  And that is the second key to success; drive and desire will get you much of the way there – but having a good plan might take you the rest of the way..
