    <string name="lesson_1_story_intro">Zara and Anwar have both been thinking about starting a new business. Zara is considering three different options: opening a tailoring shop, a clothing shop, or a jewelry shop. Anwar has also identified three different ideas: opening a restaurant, a bakery, or a coffee shop. They discuss their ideas together.</string>

    <string name="lesson_1_dialogue_3">\"You are right. It is probably better to open a clothing shop.\"</string>

    <string name="theory_model_subheader">Theory/Model</string>
    <string name="lesson_1_theory_model">Most successful new businesses address two related issues – one is an unmet customer need; the second is a new idea for meeting this need, either a new business approach or a new technology. For your business idea to work, you should try to consider both items. \n\nTake for example good quality coffee shops. Previously in many countries, coffee was not a luxury item, it was sold in restaurants or on street corners by vendors at low price. But as people have gotten wealthier, demand for quality coffee, a small luxury, has grown; meanwhile, some entrepreneurs spotted this new unmet need and came up with a new business model, providing quality coffee in comfortable environments – and successful cafes have sprouted up all over. \n\nTo come up with a business idea, try to think of: \n- What people need or want but don’t have. \n- Resources that you have access to and could use. \n- Your own strengths, talents and interests. \n- A problem you have experienced or observed, and for which you think you have a solution. \n\nAlways make sure these two things go together – Unmet customer needs and new, innovative solutions.</string>

    <string name="lesson_1_success_story">In 2007 Ritthy Paiborn was working in his father’s restaurant, doing everything from waiting on tables to washing dishes to cooking food. Like his father did as well. But whenever foreigners came in, they asked if they had coffee – and when he served the usual powdered type Nescafe, they complained. \n\nRitthy realized there was an unmet customer demand – people wanted good, Italian style espresso coffee. And they were willing to pay for it. With a bit of savings and a loan from his father, he bought an Italian coffee machine, put it outside their restaurant, and created Ritthy’s Café with sidewalk seating for five. The business flourished, selling coffee to both the restaurant customers – which helped grow his father’s business – and to people outside. \n\nToday, seven years later, Ritthy runs 10 Ritthy’s Cafes around Phnom Penh and Siem Reap, and is one of Cambodia’s best known entrepreneurs – all because he saw a customer need and found a way to meet it.</string>

    <string name="factoids">Factoids</string>
    <string name="lesson_1_factoid_1">An estimated 50% of business failure is the result of incompetence.</string>
    <string name="lesson_1_factoid_2">Of the other half, 30% is due to lack of managerial experience, 10% due to lack of general business experience, and the rest the result of fraud, natural disasters and neglect.</string>
    <string name="lesson_1_factoid_3">With careful planning, much of this can be avoided, increasing your chances of success.</string>
    <string name="conclusion">Conclusion</string>
    <string name="lesson_1_conclusion">Entrepreneurship is not easy, but it can be really rewarding. \n\nThe fact is, most entrepreneurs don’t succeed in their first try at starting a business. We learn from our mistakes. But the best way to avoid mistakes is to be aware of what they potentially can be. Consider the following as you go forward, and perhaps adjust as needed. \n\nThe most common errors made by people starting businesses include:\n
        \n\u2022\t Under-estimating the costs or resources needed.
        \n\u2022\t Not meeting customers’ quality requirements.
        \n\u2022\t Being weak on sales and marketing of your new business
        \n\u2022\t Not managing the finances well – poor accounting.
        \n\u2022\t Not being flexible and adjusting as you start.
        \n\u2022\t Not knowing your competition, and how you can do better than them.
        \n\u2022\t Setting your price too high or too low.
        \n\u2022\t Thinking that success will come easily, quickly or without lots of work.
        \n\nThe following modules will help on much of this – but the best start will be for you to consider these points and keep improving your plan.</string>
